{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}


This app provides weather inofrmation for Rexburg, ID (this can be changed in the code). It provides the weather condition, pressure, temperatures,
humidity, and visibility.

I created this app to practice a new language and create an android app. Reading from an api is a valubale skill to have.

This app was written using the kotlin language.
